Before starting this class, the learning process was very confusing and difficult for me at first since I had absolutely no foundation in programming and had never even touched the content. 
The first few classes were stressful and I had to work hard to keep up with the pace, but I still felt very overwhelmed. 
This confusion not only manifested itself during class, but also carried over to the homework after class. 
When faced with the assignments, I was almost in a state of limbo, feeling like I had no idea where to start or even basic ideas.

However, after these past few weeks of studying, especially this most recent week, I have gradually found a way to study that works for me. 
Before completing the assignments, I will watch back the recorded video of the course and carefully read the webpage introduction of this week's course to gradually sort out the knowledge points.
Meanwhile, with the help of my classmates, my understanding gradually deepened. 
Incredibly, through these efforts, I actually succeeded in completing the creation of a web page. 
Thinking back to my initial confusion and uneasiness, I really didn't think I could make such progress.

Through this course, I not only learned a lot of practical knowledge, especially the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, 
but also mastered how to solve problems through continuous debugging and experimentation. 
the process of learning CSS gave me a deeper understanding and mastery of the box model, typographic layout, and adjustment of fonts and colors. 
I began to familiarize myself with how to fine-tune page elements and gradually improve the design effect of web pages. 
The accumulation of these skills gave me more confidence in my own abilities and made me realize that although learning programming is challenging, 
substantial progress can be made through continuous trial and practice.
